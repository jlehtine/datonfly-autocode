# Copilot Instructions

Follow the architecture described in [README.md](../README.md) and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md), and the coding conventions in
[CONVENTIONS.md](../CONVENTIONS.md). This file contains only agent-specific
workflow rules. General project conventions live in those files — do not
duplicate them here.

## Framework vs. applications

These instructions, and all conventions referenced above, apply to the
**Datonfly Autocode framework implementation itself**. They do **not** apply to
applications executed within the framework — those follow their own stack's
conventions, defined by each vendor application and its stack template. When
working on framework code, use the framework stack (Node.js, strict TypeScript,
React/MUI, NestJS, pnpm + Turbo). Keep contracts in `core` stack-neutral so
non-TypeScript applications can interoperate.

## Development Phase

This software is in initial development and has not been released. Inter-package
API compatibility does not need to be maintained. Prefer simplifications over
backward-compatible changes when refactoring across packages.

The one exception is **persisted control-plane data**: control-plane state may
exist in test deployments, so database schema and stored data must be handled
carefully. Always use data-preserving migrations; never drop or alter data in a
destructive way. (Application user data is owned by vendor services, not the
framework.)

## Decision Making

Stick to the agreed plan. If during implementation you encounter unforeseen
complications, inconsistencies, or ambiguities — stop, describe the problem and
the available options to the user, and ask how to proceed before continuing.

If you cannot ask the user questions (e.g. in an autonomous/Autopilot mode where
no interactive prompt is available), do **not** guess at a significant change of
plan or work around the blocker on your own. Instead, halt and report: describe
the blocker, the decision(s) that need to be made, and the options you see, then
end your turn and wait for the user. Continue autonomously only for changes that
clearly fall within the agreed plan.

## Dependency Licensing

Vet the license of any third-party dependency before adding it.

- **Dependencies that contribute code to the final application** (compiled,
  bundled, or otherwise linked into shipped artifacts) must use MIT, BSD, Apache
  2.0, or a similarly permissive license. Do **not** add copyleft-licensed
  dependencies (e.g. GPL, LGPL, AGPL, MPL) to this category.
- **Pure runtime dependencies** (platform components invoked as separate
  processes/services and not linked into the application) may additionally use
  copyleft licenses.

If a dependency's license is unclear or does not fit these rules, stop and ask
the user before adding it.

## Linting

After code changes, run `pnpm lint:fix` and fix any linting errors caused by the
changes. Formatting is applied automatically by a commit hook, so there is no
need to check formatting.

## Version Control

Do not commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. Stage and make
commits only on explicit user permission or instruction.

## Testing

After implementing a feature, decide whether the feature warrants unit tests or
end-to-end tests. If so, implement the required tests and verify they pass.

**Run only the specific test file(s) relevant to the change** (e.g.
`pnpm exec playwright test tests/recovery.spec.ts`). Running the entire test
suite at once easily triggers LLM rate limits, causing spurious failures.

E2E tests require the dev server (`pnpm dev`) to be running. If it is not known
whether the dev server is running, ask the user to start it. If the user
previously started the dev server in the session, assume it is still running. Do
not start the dev server unless asked to or after receiving explicit permission.
